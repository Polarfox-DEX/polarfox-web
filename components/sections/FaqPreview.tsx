            Polarfox is a crypto ecosystem, based on Avalanche, which will bring
            many apps together. Its main app is the Polarfox DEX; some other
            apps have already been added to the ecosystem, such as the Polarfox
            bridge, and many others are coming. Stay tuned! It aims to be fully
            open-source and decentralized. Polarfox’s main values are trust,
            honesty and transparency.
