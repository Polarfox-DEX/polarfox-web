        Polarfox is a crypto ecosystem, based on Avalanche, which will bring
        many apps together. Its main app is the Polarfox DEX; some other apps
        have already been added to the ecosystem, such as the Polarfox bridge,
        and many others are coming. Stay tuned! It aims to be fully open-source
        and decentralized. Polarfoxâ€™s main values are trust, honesty and
        transparency.
