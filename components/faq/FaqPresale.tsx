      <Question question="When and where can I participate in the PFX presale?" isOpenDefault>
        The presale will take place right before the launch of the Polarfox DEX and last for 3 days. It will be
        accessible on the homepage of Polarfox.
      </Question>
      <Question question="How much PFX is available and what is the price?">
        9,900,000 PFX is allocated to the entire presale, released equally over 3 days (that is 3,300,000 PFX per day).
        The PFX price will be determined dynamically on each day based on the amount of ETH that participants put.
        <br />
        <br />
        Example: on Day 1, if there are 5 participants each spending 1 ETH, everyone receives 1/5 of the daily PFX sale
        pool.
      </Question>
      <Question question="How much can I spend and are there bonuses available?">
        The PFX presale aims to reward AKITA holders and does so by providing a number of bonuses to them. The more
        AKITA you hold:
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4" style={{ fontSize: calcRem(15), lineHeight: calcRem(25) }}>
          <li>The more PFX you can buy</li>
          <li>The more bonus PFX tokens you will receive</li>
          <li>The more bonus gAKITA tokens you will receive</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Please note that the bonus PFX tokens you will earn will be locked for a few months. The higher the bonus rate,
        the longer they will be locked.
